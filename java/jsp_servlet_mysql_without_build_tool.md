Building a Registration form using JSP+Servlet+JDBC+MySQL Database 



	1. This will be using the manual so here we will not be using any kind of build tool such as maven or Ant


Steps:- 

	1. Create a JSP page for the HTML
	2. Create a servlet page for the backend Code
	3. Create a Dao java class for the connection to the database
	4. Create a method in Dao Class to push the data
	5. Create a Model or bean class which will store the data pushed by the form in the Object format so that it can be reterived in in the JSP page
	6. And the store the details in Bean class object and then pass the object to the DAO Class method that will store the details in the database.





So, First we need the Eclipse with Enterprise Edition

	1. Here I will be using Eclipse Oxygen
	2. It has option to create a dynamic project
	3. That is done 
	4. I have created the jsp file I need to configure the server
	5. One of the server that can be used is Apache so here I will be using apache as our webserver.
	6. Download apache and store it in a directory and point that directory from eclipse to setup the server



Tips:- 


	1. Do not forget to execute the prepared Statement this is what happened with me that I forgot to execute the prepared statement.
